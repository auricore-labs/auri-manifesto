**Auri** (from *aurum*, “gold”) stands for **pure value**: a system that removes noise, ritual and vanity from software delivery.  
Auri replaces agile theater with **evidence, cadence and product**.

## Core Principles
1. Flow over ceremony
2. Locked scope, absolute focus
3. Evidence over estimation (Lead Time, Throughput, Bug Density, Cycle Health)
4. Technique is delivery (tests, logs, security, documentation)
5. Quality is explicit (Bugs & Technical Debt lanes)
6. Feedback is factual (15‑min retro)
7. Small teams, light coordination
8. Product > process
9. Full transparency
10. Zero theater

## Operational Structure
- **Scope Map** → defines in/out for each 1–2 week flow  
- **Auri Board** → Backlog → Scope → To Do → Doing → Review → Done → Bugs → Debt  
- **Tech Check** → tests, logs, security, documentation  
- **Metrics** → Lead Time, Throughput, Bug Density, Cycle Health  
- **Retro** → 15 minutes, 1 technical + 1 process decision
