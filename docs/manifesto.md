# ✨ The Auri Manifesto  
### “Value Without Noise.”

---

## 🌌 Prologue — Why Auri Exists

We grew tired of *agile theater* — rituals without outcomes, estimates without evidence, and meetings that measure nothing.  
**Auri** means value refined — like gold. It is the **operating system** for teams that remove noise and ship product.

Where others discuss *velocity*, Auri measures **truth**.  
Where others chase *ceremony*, Auri builds **clarity**.  
Where others plan, Auri **delivers**.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Auri replaces faith with evidence and ceremony with **flow**.  
It’s for teams that ship fast, measure honestly, and improve without politics.  
The only goal is value — **measurable, continuous, sustainable**.

## ⚖️ Core Values

> **We value...**  
> - Flow over ceremony.  
> - Evidence over estimation.  
> - Cadence over control.  
> - Transparency over politics.  
> - Product over process.  
> - Discipline over drama.  
> - Quality over quantity.  
> - Truth over tradition.  

These are not slogans — they are **constraints**. Freedom comes from boundaries that work.

## 🔩 Principles of Auri

1. **Flow before form** — movement matters more than method.  
2. **Scope is sacred** — nothing enters mid‑cycle.  
3. **Data is law** — Lead Time, Throughput, Bug Density, Cycle Health.  
4. **Technique is delivery** — tests, logs, security, documentation are *core*.  
5. **Quality is visible** — bugs and debt get lanes, not excuses.  
6. **Feedback is factual** — retros based on metrics, not feelings.  
7. **Teams are micro‑systems** — small, autonomous, connected via hubs.  
8. **Product defines process** — not the other way around.  
9. **Transparency beats control** — shared data ends politics.  
10. **Zero theater** — meetings die when flow speaks for itself.

## 🧩 The Auri System

| Pillar | Purpose | Example |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Scope Map** | defines what is in or out per cycle | “Signup and login, no notifications” |
| **Auri Board** | controls real flow | Backlog → Scope → To Do → Doing → Review → Done → Bugs → Debt |
| **Tech Check** | enforces quality discipline | tests, logs, security, doc |
| **Metrics** | base of predictability | Lead Time, Throughput, Bug Density, Cycle Health |
| **Retro** | short, factual reflection | 15 minutes, 2 measurable actions |

---

## ⚙️ Metrics that Matter

| Metric | Measures | Target |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Lead Time** | speed per card | ≤ 2 days |
| **Throughput** | volume of deliveries | ≥ 80 % planned |
| **Bug Density** | quality ratio | ≤ 0.2 |
| **Cycle Health** | balance speed × quality | ≥ 0.85 |
| **Tech Debt** | accumulated refactors | ≤ 10 pts |

## 🚦 The Anti‑Scrum Guide

| Situation | Auri Response |
|------------|----------------|
| New feature mid‑flow | **Next cycle** — scope is locked. |
| Refactor request | Critical → now; else → Debt lane. |
| Production bug | Critical → fix now; Minor → Bugs Next Flow. |
| Delivery forecast | LeadTime_avg × Throughput_avg = truth. |
| Dailies waste time | Replace with **FlowSync** (async text line). |
| Multi‑team work | Weekly **Hub Connection** (30 min, 3 actions). |
| Under‑delivery | Metrics expose stagnation — no blame. |
| Client asks status | Show the board. The board *is* the report. |
| Retro | 15 min, data‑driven, not emotional. |
| Process change | Only with pre/post metric comparison. |

---

## 🧱 Roles and Structure

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Developer** | Delivers cards with full DoD. |
| **Tech Lead / Hub** | Maintains architectural rhythm, enforces metrics. |
| **Product Lead / Hub** | Aligns priorities and defines Scope Map. |
| **Ops Bridge** | Monitors Cycle Health and delivery predictability. |

---

## 🔁 The Auri Cycle

1. Define **Scope Map** (7–14 days).  
2. Start flow — **no new entries** mid‑cycle.  
3. Track **Lead Time** and **Throughput** daily.  
4. Fix critical bugs immediately, defer minor ones.  
5. **Retro (15 min)** — produce two measurable actions.  
6. Begin next cycle — repeat.

> Predictability is rhythm, not rigidity.

## 🧬 Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Flow** | continuous, visible movement of value. |
| **Scope Map** | the fixed boundaries of each cycle. |
| **Lead Time** | time from start → done per card. |
| **Throughput** | count of cards completed in a cycle. |
| **Bug Density** | number of bugs ÷ total deliveries. |
| **Cycle Health** | weighted index of flow × quality. |
| **Debt Lane** | intentional backlog for technical refactors. |
| **FlowSync** | asynchronous status (yesterday/today/blocker). |
| **Hub** | coordination point between autonomous teams. |

---

## 🪶 Cultural Shift

Auri is not about moving faster — it’s about **moving without friction**.  
It’s not about more work — it’s about **work that counts**.  
And it’s not about control — it’s about **visibility that kills control**.
